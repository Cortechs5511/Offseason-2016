I have included the builds folder for the dashboard I have been working on.
To make this dashboard work on your computer, copy this folder, go into your Labview Data folder, find the builds folder, and paste this in there
Then, open up your driver station, find the third vertical tab on the left, with a gear symbol, and select "Labview" for dashboard type
Hopefully my dashboard will appear
